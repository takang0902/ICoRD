Iterative correlation-based ROI detection (ICoRD)

The algorithm is presented in more detail in
Kang, Seongtak, et al. "ICoRD: Iterative Correlation-Based ROI Detection Method for the Extraction of Neural Signals in Calcium Imaging." bioRxiv (2021).

Code description
=======
This repository only contains a MATLAB implementation of ICoRD

For the ICoRD demo, you only need to run the ICoRD_v_1_1.mat code.

Simulation_data_generation_v_1_1.mat is the code for generating simulation data for verification.
